# pandas-challenge-1

This program is a demonstration on how to use pandas in order to manipulate a dataframe and the data within. In this program a dataframe containing a list of different clients and their orders is manipulated in order to find the top 5 clients. These clients are then put in their own dataframe containing their total number of units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit.

In order to properly run this program you will need to have pandas installed
